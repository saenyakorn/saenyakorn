# Saenyakorn Siangsanoh

a sophomore student at the Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University

I'm currently working as <i>Frontend Developer</i> and <i>UX/UI Designer</i>

Recently I plan to build my personal website and to develope some application for Chulalongkorn University's students as a [Thinc.](https://github.com/thinc-org) member. Please look forward to it.
